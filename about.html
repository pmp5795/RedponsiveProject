                                <p class="pera">The Wedding Planners are Mumbai-based wedding planners that provide a one-stop solution for your wedding and related events.</p>

                               <p class="pera">As a wedding planner in India, we bring unique touches to weddings, focusing on executing your special day down to the last detail. This means that we take care of presenting you with only the most suitable venues and vendors according to your budget and taste. We at Marry Me work closely with you — the couple — and your families to plan a wedding that is uniquely yours and that is a reflection of your tastes. This means that whether you opt for a small and intimate wedding, a large-scale production, or even an exotic destination wedding, we will make your wedding day the most special and unique — one that will be remembered forever. We take pleasure in the fact that we have been able to create memorable moments by blending Indian tastes and tradition with contemporary touches.</p>

                               <p class="pera">It goes without saying that planning a wedding comes with endless days of planning. It can be challenging, especially for those who opt to plan a wedding themselves. We at Marry Me take the stress away from wedding planning by handling it all. Of course, you can choose to be involved in the wedding planning process as much or as little as you require. Backed with experience in Indian wedding planning and an extensive network of wedding vendors, we aim to make your wedding day stress-free and enjoyable not just for you but also for your family.</p>

                               <p class="pera">Apart from this, we at The Wedding Planner, are always on the lookout for beautiful things for weddings – gifts, packaging, statationery, décor and so on. We then thought about making these gorgeous products available through a store. Launched in 2012, Marry Me - The Store has an extensive range of products curated by us.</p>

                               <p class="pera">Our love for flowers and all things pretty, also led to the launch of House of Flowers by The Wedding P;lanning. At House of Flowers, we specialize in creating memories—classic and romantic yet modern stylized floral arrangements.</p>
